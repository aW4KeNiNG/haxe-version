# version library for Haxe

Haxe macros useful for including version strings (version from `haxelib.json`, git commit hash and Haxe version) to a target build.

See [Version.hx](https://github.com/ypid/haxe-version/blob/master/Version.hx) for details.

Credits for the idea go to [Andy Li](http://blog.onthewings.net/) who presented a similar macro using `git describe --tags` in [Haxe, a language that compiles to JS](http://blog.onthewings.net/about/).
